<p>
  This project had been started as a python REST library for Kaa but after the project grew,
  we decided to complete it as the standalone platform.
</p>
<p>
  In the beginning, we use <a href="https://github.com/eljalalpour/SDN101">SDN101</a> project as a good example of python REST API client.
  SDN101 is a great memory for Parham Alvani good old days.
</p>
<p>
  When 18.20 decide to leave us alone, we created an improved version of it,
  in this version we provide everything you need in a simple package and the journey started here.
</p>
<p>
  I1820 first was used in <a href="http://aolab.github.io/">Aolab</a> but after Aolab closed, it continues its life as the standalone project. After almost 1 year and many experiences,
  the new architecture is here. mainly new needs and considerations are based on <a href="http://isrc.ac.ir/">ISRC</a> platform project.
