<p>
  This project had been started as a python REST library for kaa but after project grew,
  we decided to complete it as stand alone platform.
</p>
<p>
  In the begining we use <a href="https://github.com/eljalalpour/SDN101">SDN101</a> project as a good example of python REST API client.
  SDN101 is a great memory for Parham Alvani good old days.
</p>
<p>
  When 18.20 decide to leave us alone, we created improved version of it, in this version we provide everything you need in simple package
  and the journey started here.
</p>
<p>
  I1820 first was used in Aolab but after Aolab closed, it continues it life as stanalone project. After almost 1 year and many experiences
  new architecture is here. mainly new needs and considerations are based on <a href="http://isrc.ac.ir/">ISRC</a> platform project.
