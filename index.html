<h1>What and Why?</h1>
<p>
  I1820 is IoT Platform that can manage many things for you from things to project and from raw data to information.
  It adopts a new vision for data management. In I1820 you have two choices, one is to create your codecs based on python
  to encode and decode your data or another is to use native models.
  In I1820 models refer to the way you want to encode and decode your data and we provide some native models based on our ideas.
</p>

<p>
  I1820 have projects, in projects you have your things, your codecs, and your scenarios.
  The scenario is a python script that runs on each coming data into the project and you have always one instance of running scenario in each project (it is a promise).
</p>

<p>
  I1820 have protocols, in the link component, each of the bottom layer protocols represents by Protocol
  that can be added into the code so easily. We have protocols for LAN, LoRa and more is coming.
